# TextTranslate Chatbot using AWS Lex, Lambda, and Amazon Translate

## Step 1: Bot Creation
I began by building the foundation of the chatbot using **Amazon Lex** with a blank bot. I configured a descriptive name, `TextTranslate`, and provided a clear description of its purpose. I set up an IAM role with basic Lex permissions, selected **English (US)** as the default language, and chose voice settings for interactions. The default intent classification confidence threshold was maintained to ensure the bot accurately interprets user input.

## Step 2: Intent and Slot Configuration
Next, I defined the `TranslateIntent` and its associated slots to enable meaningful user interactions. I added sample **utterances** to help the bot understand user queries and created **slots** to capture key information: the text to be translated and the target language. A custom slot type was used for supported languages, while `AMAZON.FreeFormInput` was used for text input, allowing the bot to dynamically extract user-provided information.

## Step 3: Fulfillment with Lambda Integration
I integrated a **Lambda function** to handle the intentâ€™s execution and fulfill user requests. The bot was configured with prompts to provide feedback on successful or failed actions, ensuring a smooth user experience, and a closing message to gracefully end the interaction.

## Step 4: IAM Role and Permissions
An **IAM role** was created to enable the Lambda function with the necessary permissions. The role was trusted by AWS Lambda and attached the policies `TranslateFullAccess` and `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`, allowing secure execution and access to Amazon Translate.

## Step 5: Lambda Function Implementation
- **Lambda_function.py**: Handles input from Lex, validates the text and language slots, calls Amazon Translate, and returns the translated result to the bot.  
- **languages.py**: Contains a comprehensive list of languages mapped to their ISO codes for translation.  

I tested the Lambda function independently to ensure it returned valid JSON responses compatible with Amazon Lex. This verification confirmed that translated messages could be properly displayed to users.

## Step 6: Chatbot Testing
To test the chatbot, I navigated to the **Intent page** and linked the Lambda function sgit o Lex could invoke it during interactions. After connecting the Lambda function, the chatbot was ready for end-to-end testing. I validated its performance using sample conversations, confirming that it accurately handled user input, translated text in real-time, and responded gracefully to errors or missing information.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a fully functional, intelligent chatbot using **AWS Lex, Lambda, and Amazon Translate**. I built a robust, user-friendly system that handles natural language input, validates data, manages errors gracefully, and provides real-time translations. It showcases my skills in **cloud architecture, serverless development, and practical problem-solving**, highlighting my ability to deliver scalable, production-ready solutions that meet user needs effectively.
